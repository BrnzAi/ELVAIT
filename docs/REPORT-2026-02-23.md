- Changed primary CTA from "Get Started" to "Start Free Assessment"
- Links to `/create` for immediate assessment start
- Branding changed from "Clarity Kit" to "ELVAIT" in nav

### New Section: "See Results Instantly"
Three-column comparison showing tiered access:

| Tier | Price | What You Get |
|------|-------|--------------|
| **Free** | €0 | Quick Check, basic GO/FIX/NO-GO verdict, ICS score |
| **Try Out** | €199/3mo | Full Standard assessment, 50 respondents, all insights |
| **Paid Plans** | From €1,900/yr | Multiple assessments, PDF reports, advanced features |

### Trust Section
Added new section with three pillars:
- **Private & Secure** — HTTPS, unique tokens, only creator sees results
- **Instant Results** — AI analysis in seconds
- **Multi-Stakeholder** — Collect from executives, tech leads, end users

## 3. Email Verification Enforcement

### Clarification
Email verification **IS required** before users can sign in and unlock Tier 1 features.

### Flow
```
Sign up → Verification email sent → "Check your email" screen
    ↓
Click verification link → Email verified
    ↓
Sign in → Full results access (Tier 1+)
```

### Implementation Verified
- `src/lib/auth/config.ts` — Throws `EMAIL_NOT_VERIFIED` error for unverified users
- `src/app/(auth)/signin/page.tsx` — Shows clear error message
- `src/app/(auth)/signup/page.tsx` — Shows "Check your email" after registration
- No auto-sign-in after registration

### Documentation Updated
- `docs/SPEC-results-gate.md` — Changed from "do not require" to "require email verification"
- `src/app/page.tsx` — FAQ answer updated

---
