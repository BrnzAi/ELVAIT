<li><strong>Sub-processing.</strong> The Processor shall not engage another processor without prior general written authorisation of the Controller. The Controller hereby grants general authorisation for the sub-processors listed in Section 7. The Processor shall inform the Controller of any intended changes and provide the Controller an opportunity to object.</li>
<li><strong>Data Subject Rights.</strong> The Processor shall assist the Controller, by appropriate technical and organisational measures, in fulfilling the Controller's obligation to respond to data subject requests under Chapter III GDPR.</li>
<li><strong>Assistance.</strong> The Processor shall assist the Controller in ensuring compliance with Articles 32–36 GDPR, taking into account the nature of processing and information available to the Processor.</li>

</ul>

<h2>6. Data Location</h2>
<p>All Personal Data is stored and processed within the European Union, specifically in the Google Cloud <strong>europe-west1</strong> (Belgium) region.

<p>The Processor shall notify the Controller at least <strong>30 days</strong> in advance of any intended addition or replacement of sub-processors, giving the Controller the opportunity to object. If the Controller objects on reasonable data protection grounds and the parties cannot resolve the objection, the Controller may terminate the Service.</p>

<h2>8. Data Breach Notification</h2>

<p>Where Personal Data is transferred to a sub-processor outside the EU/EEA (e.g., Resend, Inc.), such transfer shall be subject to appropriate safeguards, including the European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses (Module 3: Processor to Sub-processor) as adopted by Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2021/914, or any successor mechanism approved under GDPR.</p>

<h2>11. Liability</h2>
<p>Each party's liability under this DPA is subject to the limitations set out in the ELVAIT Terms of Service, except that neither party's liability for breaches of its GDPR obligations shall be limited to the extent prohibited by applicable law.</p>

<h2>12. Term and Termination</h2>
<p>This DPA takes effect upon the Controller's acceptance of the ELVAIT Terms of Service and remains in force for the duration of the Processor's processing of Personal Data on behalf of the Controller. Obligations that by their nature should survive termination (including Sections 7, 8, 9, and 11) shall survive.</p>

<h2>13. Governing Law</h2>
<p>This DPA shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany, without regard to conflict-of-law principles. The courts of Munich, Germany shall have exclusive jurisdiction.</p>

<h2>14. Amendments</h2>
